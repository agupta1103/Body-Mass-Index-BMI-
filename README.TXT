POST MORTEM REVIEW (PMR):
I thoroughly enjoyed writing this code even though it did take me some 
thought, effort, and a little bit of time to correctly write everything/
get everything right. It was very interesting and I felt very accomplished
after I was able to successfully operate the program to verify that all the 
code I had written was correct.
